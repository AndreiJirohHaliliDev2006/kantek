# Kantek

![](https://i.sitischu.com/kantek_main_smol_256.png)


Kantek is a userbot written in Python using Telethon.

## A word of warning

Kantek is mostly built to help with the Administration of chats and is the main source for [SpamWat.ch](https://spamwat.ch) and used for automatically banning pajeets across [the Pins team Community Network][network-faq]
Because of that it checks every message your account receives for blacklisted items, this includes strings, domains, top level domains, files, images and telegram entities. This means that for every message your account receives Kantek might make multiple http requests an resolve multiple telegram entities. The latter might lead to large (6+ hours) Floodwaits from Telegram.

If you want to use Kantek without the administration part, simply remove the `plugins/autobahn` folder to disable these features.

## Requirements

Python 3.6+ is required to run the bot.
ArangoDB 3.5+ is used to store bot data.

## How to self-host?

- Copy the example config file to `config.json`
- Create a user and a Database in ArangoDB. Give the user full permissions to the Database. The config defaults to the user and database name to `kantek` can be changed with [db_username](#db_username) and [db_name](#db_name) respectively. 
- Put the Authentication data into the config file.
- Run bot.py
